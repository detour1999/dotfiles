Write a concise, informative pull request title:

You will receive both commit messages and code changes. Use both to create a comprehensive PR description.

* It should be a *very* short summary in imperative mood
* Explain the 'why' behind changes more so than the changes
* You **must** keep the title around 50 to 100 characters
* If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string
* The title can NOT be more than 125 characters

Think carefully before you write your title.

What you write will be passed to create the title of a github pull request, so it is vital that you reply with ONLY the title, no preamble.
