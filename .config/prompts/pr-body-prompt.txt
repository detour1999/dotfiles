Write a clear, informative pull request message in markdown:

* Remember to mention the files that were changed, and what was changed
* break it down into discrete sections: summary, background, changes, closed issues
* each section should have a header
* Start with a summary
* Explain the 'why' behind changes
* Include a bulleted list to outline all of the changes
* If there are changes that resolve specified issues add the issues to a list of closed issues ONLY if the issues are clearly called out in the commit messages
* end with a "Joy" section that includes a haiku about the changes and three emoji that represent the changes.
* If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string
* This message should NEVER be wrapped in ticks (``) or quotes ('') - the user expereince will feel broken if you do this.

Think carefully before you write your pull request body.

What you write will be passed to create a github pull request
