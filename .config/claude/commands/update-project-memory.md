Review our project memory (CLAUDE.md) and recent development work, then suggest improvements to the memory based on:

1. **Recent challenges encountered** - What problems did we solve that should be documented?
2. **New patterns discovered** - What techniques or approaches worked well?
3. **Gaps in current guidance** - What situations weren't covered by existing memory?
4. **Outdated or redundant sections** - What should be updated, consolidated, or removed?
5. **Missing troubleshooting scenarios** - What common issues should future developers know about?

After analyzing recent commits and current memory, provide specific suggestions for:

- New sections to add
- Existing content to modify
- Redundancies to remove
- Better organization of information

Don't implement the changes yet - just give me recommendations so I can decide what to update.
