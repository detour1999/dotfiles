Review my global CLAUDE.md (personal development guidelines) and reflect on recent work patterns across projects, then suggest improvements based on:

1. **Communication Evolution** - How has my preferred communication style changed? What works best for me now?
2. **Decision-Making Patterns** - What principles guide my choices? Have my priorities shifted?
3. **Learning Preferences** - How do I best absorb new information and solve problems?
4. **Quality Standards** - What are my non-negotiables vs. acceptable trade-offs?
5. **Work Philosophy Changes** - Have my views on code quality, collaboration, or process evolved?
6. **Productivity Insights** - What approaches consistently help or hinder my effectiveness?

After analyzing my recent interactions and current global memory, suggest:

- Personal principles that should be documented
- Communication preferences that should be clarified
- Work habits that should be reinforced or changed
- Values that should be made explicit
- Outdated guidance that no longer reflects how I work

Focus on HOW I work best and WHY I make certain choices, not specific technologies.
