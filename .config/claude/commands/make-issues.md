# Checklist to GitHub Issues Workflow

I need you to convert the checklist items in project-plan.md into a structured set of GitHub issues. Please follow this standardized workflow:

## 1. Project Context Analysis

- Analyze project-plan.md to understand the checklist structure
- Read project.md to gather overall project context
- Identify hierarchical relationships between checklist items (e.g., top-level items and sub-items)
- Determine logical groupings of related tasks

## 2. GitHub Project Setup

- Check if a GitHub project already exists for this work
- If not, create a new GitHub project with an appropriate name based on the project context
- Set up appropriate project columns (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done")

## 3. Issue Existence Check and Creation

- For each checklist item, search for existing GitHub issues with similar titles or content
- If an existing issue is found:
  - Compare the checklist item with the existing issue
  - Enhance the existing issue by:
    - Adding any missing details from the checklist item
    - Updating technical context based on project.md
    - Refining the definition of done if needed
    - Preserving existing comments, labels, and assignments
  - Note that the issue was enhanced rather than created
- If no existing issue is found:
  - For top-level checklist items:
    - Create a parent issue with a descriptive title reflecting the overall objective
    - Include in the body:
      - Clear description of the overall objective
      - Technical context from project.md relevant to this work area
      - Definition of done for the entire section
      - References to related documentation or resources
  - For sub-items:
    - Create a child issue with a concise, descriptive title for the specific task
    - Include in the body:
      - Detailed description of what needs to be implemented
      - Technical specifications and requirements
      - Clear definition of done for this specific task
      - Any dependencies on other issues
      - Estimated level of effort (if determinable)

## 4. Issue Organization

- Link child issues to their parent issues
- Add all issues to the GitHub project
- Apply appropriate labels to categorize issues (e.g., "frontend", "backend", "documentation")
- Set appropriate milestones if applicable
- Prioritize issues based on dependencies and project timeline

## 5. Project Overview Creation

- Check if a summary issue already exists
- If it does, update it with any new information
- If not, create a summary issue that provides an overview of the entire project
- Include links to all parent issues
- Add this overview to the GitHub project as a pinned item
- Create a project README or update the existing one with information about the issue structure

## 6. Verification and Reporting

- Verify all checklist items have been converted to issues or enhanced existing ones
- Ensure proper parent-child relationships are established
- Generate a summary report of all created and enhanced issues
- Provide a concise overview of the project structure and next steps

Please begin by analyzing the project files and then proceed with creating a structured set of GitHub issues that accurately represents the project plan.
