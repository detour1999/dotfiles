Open @docs/todo.md and select the first unchecked items to work on.
Open @docs/plan.md and find the corresponding step which should have a prompt.
Open @docs/spec.md to get the full context of what this item is a part of.

Create a new branch and implement that prompt:

- Branch from the current branch (not main) and ensure PR targets the branch you branched from.
- Write robust, well-documented code.
- Include comprehensive tests and debug logging.
- Verify that all tests pass.
- Check off the items on todo.md
- Commit and push, then create a PR (you can use the custom `git pr` command which will run a script that auto summarize everything)
