Open @docs/todo.md and select the first unchecked items to work on.
Open @docs/plan.md and find the corresponding step which should have a prompt.
Create a new branch and implement that prompt:

- Write robust, well-documented code.
- Include comprehensive tests and debug logging.
- Verify that all tests pass.
  Commit and push, then create a PR (you can use the custom `git pr` command which will run a script that auto summarize everything)
  Check off the items on todo.md
